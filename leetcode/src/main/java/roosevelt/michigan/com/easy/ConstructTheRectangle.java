/**
 * For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's
 * size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to
 * design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
 * following requirements:
 * 
 * 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
 * target area.
 * 
 * 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * 
 * 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as
 * possible.
 * 
 * You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed
 * in sequence.
